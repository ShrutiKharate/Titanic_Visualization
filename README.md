# ðŸ“Š Titanic Visualization Project

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview:

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.

Used Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Focused on uncovering patterns in survival rates based on different features.


## ðŸ”¹ Key Steps:

Loaded and cleaned the Titanic dataset.

Plotted survival counts, class distribution, and gender statistics.

Visualized relationships between survival, gender, and passenger class.

Analyzed Age and Fare distributions with histograms and boxplots.

Generated a correlation heatmap to identify feature relationships.

Created a pairplot for multivariate analysis.


## ðŸ”¹ Key Insights:

Females and 1st-class passengers had a higher chance of survival.

Most passengers were from 3rd class and were young adults.

Higher fare prices were slightly correlated with survival.


## ðŸ”¹ Tools Used:

Pandas for data handling

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
